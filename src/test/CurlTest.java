      "There was once a king who had an illness, and no one believed that he\n"
          + "would come out of it with his life.  He had three sons who were much\n"
          + "distressed about it, and went down into the palace-garden and wept.\n"
          + "There they met an old man who inquired as to the cause of their\n"
          + "grief.  They told him that their father was so ill that he would most\n"
          + "certainly die, for nothing seemed to cure him.  Then the old man\n"
          + "said, \"I know of one more remedy, and that is the water of life.  If\n"
          + "he drinks of it he will become well again, but it is hard to find.\"\n"
          + "The eldest said, \"I will manage to find it.\" And went to the sick\n"
          + "king, and begged to be allowed to go forth in search of the water of\n"
          + "life, for that alone could save him.  \"No,\" said the king, \"the\n"
          + "danger of it is too great.  I would rather die.\"\n" + "\n"
          + "But he begged so long that the king consented.  The prince thought in\n"
          + "his heart, \"If I bring the water, then I shall be best beloved of my\n"
          + "father, and shall inherit the kingdom.\" So he set out, and when he\n"
          + "had ridden forth a little distance, a dwarf stood there in the road\n"
          + "who called to him and said, \"Whither away so fast?\" \"Silly shrimp,\"\n"
          + "said the prince, very haughtily, \"it is nothing to do with you.\" And\n"
          + "rode on.  But the little dwarf had grown angry, and had wished an\n"
          + "evil wish.  Soon after this the prince entered a ravine, and the\n"
          + "further he rode the closer the mountains drew together, and at last\n"
          + "the road became so narrow that he could not advance a step further.\n"
          + "It was impossible either to turn his horse or to dismount from the\n"
          + "saddle, and he was shut in there as if in prison.  The sick king\n"
          + "waited long for him, but he came not.\n" + "\n"
          + "Then the second son said, \"father, let me go forth to seek the\n"
          + "water.\" And thought to himself, \"If my brother is dead, then the\n"
          + "kingdom will fall to me.\" At first the king would not allow him to go\n"
          + "either, but at last he yielded, so the prince set out on the same\n"
          + "road that his brother had taken, and he too met the dwarf, who\n"
          + "stopped him to ask whither he was going in such haste.  \"Little\n"
          + "shrimp,\" said the prince, \"that is nothing to do with you.\" And rode\n"
          + "on without giving him another look.  But the dwarf bewitched him, and\n"
          + "he, like the other, rode into a ravine, and could neither go forwards\n"
          + "nor backwards.  So fare haughty people.\n" + "\n"
          + "As the second son also remained away, the youngest begged to be\n"
          + "allowed to go forth to fetch the water, and at last the king was\n"
          + "obliged to let him go.  When he met the dwarf and the latter asked\n"
          + "him whither he was going in such haste, he stopped, gave him an\n"
          + "explanation, and said, \"I am seeking the water of life, for my father\n"
          + "is sick unto death.\"\n" + "\n" + "\"Do you know, then, where that is to be found?\"\n"
          + "\n" + "\"No,\" said the prince.\n" + "\n"
          + "\"As you have borne yourself as is seemly, and not haughtily like your\n"
          + "false brothers, I will give you the information and tell you how you\n"
          + "may obtain the water of life.  It springs from a fountain in the\n"
          + "courtyard of an enchanted castle, but you will not be able to make\n"
          + "your way to it, if I do not give you an iron wand and two small\n"
          + "loaves of bread.  Strike thrice with the wand on the iron door of the\n"
          + "castle and it will spring open, inside lie two lions with gaping\n"
          + "jaws, but if you throw a loaf to each of them, they will be quieted.\n"
          + "Then hasten to fetch some of the water of life before the clock\n"
          + "strikes twelve else the door will shut again, and you will be\n" + "imprisoned.\"\n"
          + "\n" + "The prince thanked him, took the wand and the bread, and set out on\n"
          + "his way.  When he arrived, everything was as the dwarf had said.  The\n"
          + "door sprang open at the third stroke of the wand, and when he had\n"
          + "appeased the lions with the bread, he entered the castle, and came to\n"
          + "a large and splendid hall, wherein sat some enchanted princes whose\n"
          + "rings he drew off their fingers.  A sword and a loaf of bread were\n"
          + "lying there, which he carried away.  After this, he entered a\n"
          + "chamber, in which was a beautiful maiden who rejoiced when she saw\n"
          + "him, kissed him, and told him that he had set her free, and should\n"
          + "have the whole of her kingdom, and that if he would return in a year\n"
          + "their wedding should be celebrated.  Likewise she told him where the\n"
          + "spring of the water of life was, and that he was to hasten and draw\n"
          + "some of it before the clock struck twelve.  Then he went onwards, and\n"
          + "at last entered a room where there was a beautiful newly-made bed,\n"
          + "and as he was very weary, he felt inclined to rest a little.  So he\n"
          + "lay down and fell asleep.\n" + "\n"
          + "When he awoke, it was striking a quarter to twelve.  He sprang up in\n"
          + "a fright, ran to the spring, drew some water in a cup which stood\n"
          + "near, and hastened away.  But just as he was passing through the iron\n"
          + "door, the clock struck twelve, and the door fell to with such\n"
          + "violence that it carried away a piece of his heel.\n" + "\n"
          + "He, however, rejoicing at having obtained the water of life, went\n"
          + "homewards, and again passed the dwarf.  When the latter saw the sword\n"
          + "and the loaf, he said, \"With these you have won great wealth, with\n"
          + "the sword you can slay whole armies, and the bread will never come to\n"
          + "an end.\" But the prince would not go home to his father without his\n"
          + "brothers, and said, \"Dear dwarf, can you not tell me where my two\n"
          + "brothers are?  They went out before I did in search of the water of\n"
          + "life, and have not returned.\"\n" + "\n"
          + "\"They are imprisoned between two mountains,\" said the dwarf. \"I have\n"
          + "condemned them to stay there, because they were so haughty.\" Then the\n"
          + "prince begged until the dwarf released them, but he warned him and\n"
          + "said, \"Beware of them, for they have bad hearts.\" When his brothers\n"
          + "came, he rejoiced, and told them how things had gone with him, that\n"
          + "he had found the water of life and had brought a cupful away with\n"
          + "him, and had rescued a beautiful princess, who was willing to wait a\n"
          + "year for him, and then their wedding was to be celebrated and he\n"
          + "would obtain a great kingdom.\n" + "\n"
          + "After that they rode on together, and chanced upon a land where war\n"
          + "and famine reigned, and the king already thought he must perish, for\n"
          + "the scarcity was so great.  Then the prince went to him and gave him\n"
          + "the loaf, wherewith he fed and satisfied the whole of his kingdom,\n"
          + "and then the prince gave him the sword also wherewith he slew the\n"
          + "hosts of his enemies, and could now live in rest and peace.  The\n"
          + "prince then took back his loaf and his sword, and the three brothers\n"
          + "rode on.  But after this they entered two more countries where war\n"
          + "and famine reigned and each time the prince gave his loaf and his\n"
          + "sword to the kings, and had now delivered three kingdoms, and after\n"
          + "that they went on board a ship and sailed over the sea.  During the\n"
          + "passage, the two eldest conversed apart and said, \"The youngest has\n"
          + "found the water of life and not we, for that our father will give him\n"
          + "the kingdom - the kingdom which belongs to us, and he will rob us of\n"
          + "all our fortune.\" They then began to seek revenge, and plotted with\n"
          + "each other to destroy him.  They waited until they found him fast\n"
          + "asleep, then they poured the water of life out of the cup, and took\n"
          + "it for themselves, but into the cup they poured salt sea-water.\n" + "\n"
          + "Now therefore, when they arrived home, the youngest took his cup to\n"
          + "the sick king in order that he might drink out of it, and be cured.\n"
          + "But scarcely had he drunk a very little of the salt sea-water than he\n"
          + "became still worse than before.  And as he was lamenting over this,\n"
          + "the two eldest brothers came, and accused the youngest of having\n"
          + "intended to poison him, and said that they had brought him the true\n"
          + "water of life, and handed it to him.  He had scarcely tasted it, when\n"
          + "he felt his sickness departing, and became strong and healthy as in\n"
          + "the days of his youth.\n" + "\n"
          + "After that they both went to the youngest, mocked him, and said, \"You\n"
          + "certainly found the water of life, but you have had the pain, and we\n"
          + "the gain, you should have been cleverer, and should have kept your\n"
          + "eyes open.  We took it from you whilst you were asleep at sea, and\n"
          + "when a year is over, one of us will go and fetch the beautiful\n"
          + "princess. But beware that you do not disclose aught of this to our\n"
          + "father, indeed he does not trust you, and if you say a single word,\n"
          + "you shall lose your life into the bargain, but if you keep silent,\n"
          + "you shall have it as a gift.\"\n" + "\n"
          + "The old king was angry with his youngest son, and thought he had\n"
          + "plotted against his life.  So he summoned the court together and had\n"
          + "sentence pronounced upon his son, that he should be secretly shot.\n"
          + "And once when the prince was riding forth to the chase, suspecting no\n"
          + "evil, the king's huntsman was told to go with him, and when they were\n"
          + "quite alone in the forest, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the\n"
          + "prince said to him, \"Dear huntsman, what ails you?\" The huntsman\n"
          + "said, \"I cannot tell you, and yet I ought.\" Then the prince said,\n"
          + "\"Say openly what it is, I will pardon you.\" \"Alas,\" said the\n"
          + "huntsman, \"I am to shoot you dead, the king has ordered me to do it.\"\n"
          + "Then the prince was shocked, and said, \"Dear huntsman, let me live,\n"
          + "there, I give you my royal garments, give me your common ones in\n"
          + "their stead.\" The huntsman said, \"I will willingly do that, indeed I\n"
          + "would not have been able to shoot you.\" Then they exchanged clothes,\n"
          + "and the huntsman returned home, while the prince went further into\n" + "the forest.\n"
          + "\n" + "After a time three waggons of gold and precious stones came to the\n"
          + "king for his youngest son, which were sent by the three kings who had\n"
          + "slain their enemies with the prince's sword, and maintained their\n"
          + "people with his bread, and who wished to show their gratitude for it.\n"
          + "The old king then thought, \"Can my son have been innocent?\" And said\n"
          + "to his people, \"Would that he were still alive, how it grieves me\n"
          + "that I have suffered him to be killed.\" \"He still lives,\" said the\n"
          + "huntsman, \"I could not find it in my heart to carry out your\n"
          + "command.\" And told the king how it had happened.  Then a stone fell\n"
          + "from the king's heart, and he had it proclaimed in every country that\n"
          + "his son might return and be taken into favor again.\n" + "\n"
          + "The princess, however, had a road made up to her palace which was\n"
          + "quite bright and golden, and told her people that whosoever came\n"
          + "riding straight along it to her, would be the right one and was to be\n"
          + "admitted, and whoever rode by the side of it, was not the right one\n"
          + "and was not to be admitted.\n" + "\n"
          + "As the time was now close at hand, the eldest thought he would hasten\n"
          + "to go to the king's daughter, and give himself out as her rescuer,\n"
          + "and thus win her for his bride, and the kingdom to boot.  Therefore\n"
          + "he rode forth, and when he arrived in front of the palace, and saw\n"
          + "the splendid golden road, he thought, it would be a sin and a shame\n"
          + "if I were to ride over that.  And turned aside, and rode on the right\n"
          + "side of it. But when he came to the door, the servants told him that\n"
          + "he was not the right one, and was to go away again.\n" + "\n"
          + "Soon after this the second prince set out, and when he came to the\n"
          + "golden road, and his horse had put one foot on it, he thought, it\n"
          + "would be a sin and a shame, a piece might be trodden off.  And he\n"
          + "turned aside and rode on the left side of it, and when he reached the\n"
          + "door, the attendants told him he was not the right one, and he was to\n"
          + "go away again.\n" + "\n"
          + "When at last the year had entirely expired, the third son likewise\n"
          + "wished to ride out of the forest to his beloved, and with her forget\n"
          + "his sorrows.  So he set out and thought of her so incessantly, and\n"
          + "wished to be with her so much, that he never noticed the golden road\n"
          + "at all.  So his horse rode onwards up the middle of it, and when he\n"
          + "came to the door, it was opened and the princess received him with\n"
          + "joy, and said he was her saviour, and lord of the kingdom, and their\n"
          + "wedding was celebrated with great rejoicing.  When it was over she\n"
          + "told him that his father invited him to come to him, and had forgiven\n" + "him.\n"
          + "\n" + "So he rode thither, and told him everything, how his brothers had\n"
          + "betrayed him, and how he had nevertheless kept silence.  The old king\n"
          + "wished to punish them, but they had put to sea, and never came back\n"
